- 👋 Hi, I’m @ShiyuDeng
- 🌱 I’m currently a graduate student in Physics (4th-year) at Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge.
- 👀 I’m interested in solid state systems with strongly correlated physics. 
      I’m looking to collaborate on density functional theory based first-principle calculations 
      and high-pressure, low-temperature technique to explore how the phases and properties could be tuned in magnetic, ferroelectric and multiferroic systems. 
      Large-facilities will be my exploration within the next few years to see whether I could combine experiments
- 💞️ During my free time, I enjoy tennis, hiking, photographing a lot 
     and a little bit filming and editing if I could have been free. (Though there has been barely free time left due to the PhD study...)
- 📫 Drop me an email at sd864@cam.ac.uk for academic/research or dengsy1613@outlook.com for photography/hiking etc.
